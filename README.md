# Debets Protocol
Debets Protocol is a decentralized, p2p iGaming platform, where players bet against each other(Liquity providers) instead of against a bookmaker or a Web2 casino. It is built completely on blockchain technology, and powered by smart contracts.

Debets is a permissionless system, which means that the system allows any ERC20 token holder to open a bet with their tokens. In this platform, you can become the House(adding liquidity) or be a player. Anyone can bet, provide liquidity, or create new markets at will.
